Couple of important points.

1. Maven - You had to use the assembly plugin to get it to the point of jar with dependencies. Probably not the right way to do it.
2. Apache Poi - Remember you used it in the main class.
3. Apache taka - Parser for picking up the file names.
4. Finding in the directory files.
5. TODO you didn't do the logging.
